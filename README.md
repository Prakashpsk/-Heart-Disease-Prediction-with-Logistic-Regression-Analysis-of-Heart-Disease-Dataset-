## Skills/Concepts Developed
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Logistic Regression modeling
- Feature importance analysis

## Problem Statement
One of the hospitals has a patient dataset containing various heart-related features. The goal is to build a logistic regression model to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not. Additionally, we calculate the feature importance to understand the factors contributing to heart disease.

## Impact of Your Work
This project enables healthcare professionals to leverage data-driven insights for more accurate diagnosis and treatment of heart-related conditions, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of care.

## Modeling
### Steps
1. Read the heart dataset.
2. Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to check data quality and treat missing values.
3. Transform categorical data into numerical format.
4. Apply logistic regression model.
5. Print model results.
6. Calculate feature importance.

## Visualization
Include visualizations from EDA and model evaluation metrics.

## Conclusion
Through this project, we successfully developed a logistic regression model to predict heart disease and identified important features contributing to the diagnosis. This model can assist healthcare professionals in making more informed decisions for better patient care.

## Recommendations
- Regularly update the dataset with new patient data for improved model performance.
- Explore other machine learning algorithms for comparison and potentially better accuracy.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the code in your preferred Python environment.
